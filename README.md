# IMDb Movie Analytics Project

This project explores the relationship between film budgets, revenues, and ratings using the IMDb dataset (5,000+ records from Kaggle).  
It demonstrates **data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** in Python.

---

## Objectives
- Understand how budget influences revenue.
- Identify correlations between critic scores and audience ratings.
- Discover trends in movie production and audience preferences.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Visual Studio Code
- Excel (for initial data exploration)

---

## Key Insights
- Higher budgets generally lead to higher revenues, but not always.
- Criticsâ€™ ratings are not strongly tied to budget size.
- Shorter, innovative films have become more popular in recent years.
- Renowned directors and cast members significantly improve performance.
